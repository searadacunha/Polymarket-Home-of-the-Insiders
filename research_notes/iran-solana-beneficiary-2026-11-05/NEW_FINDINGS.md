# New findings, 5 November 2026: Iran cluster E beneficiary

Full detail, limits and rejected leads are in [REPORT.md](REPORT.md). Each figure is recomputed offline by `verify.py` from `evidence/`.

## 1. Two more Polymarket accounts paid the common Solana beneficiary

- **Established:**
  - oveiStheair (`0x97e490d61b530d5078348d76143a25c43a47164d`) and aaamsaasa (`0x0a142164f48dab6448872f0abac310d03e305316`) sent 32,210.572027 and 27,150.675873 USDC.e through five Relay orders on 28 February 2026 to `4dLZQynk9SZJf6PCAV73828TZHGJaf9kWgpKVUzV4Fwy`.
  - That is the same beneficiary as BlueElephant666 and SemiconductorIT, and their share is 84.7 % of the 70,065.262869 USDC.e it received.
- **Decisive evidence:** for each of the 11 orders, three records agree:
  - the Relay request names the account as `user` and the beneficiary as `recipient`;
  - the Polygon receipt shows the proxy wallet's USDC.e Transfer to the Relay Depository for the exact amount;
  - the Solana credit carries the Relay order identifier as its memo.
- **Consequence:**
  - The beneficiary links four Polymarket accounts, not two.
  - Both new accounts bet "US strikes Iran by February 28" Yes before the 05:28 window used by phase 2, which is why that phase missed them.
  - Both were funded days in advance: from BSC through Relay, and from Crypto.com.

## 2. The beneficiary's money went to one Bybit customer deposit address

- **Established:**
  - 842.687802663 SOL, 98.35 % of the beneficiary's 856.840698827 SOL, went in 11 transfers to `Agnhk1VsurW1ic3YNDtp3NeLTGYCiaaUwpRSKag9PdpV`. Only 12.4478221 SOL went to Privacy Cash and 1.7 SOL to an unlabeled wallet.
  - After SemiconductorIT's last credit at 16:20:47, there is a single outflow: 69.068480977 SOL to that address at 16:21:06.
  - The address is labelled Bybit Deposit (Agnhk). Bybit's gas distributor tops it up, and its SOL is swept to Bybit Hot Wallet 10 (842.691342663 SOL on 28 February).
- **Decisive evidence:**
  - the complete 66-transaction history, with a continuous balance from 0 to 0;
  - service behaviour verified independently of the label: one gas wallet funds 17 addresses in a single slot, and the hot wallet has 242 senders in two hours.
- **Consequence:**
  - The trace ends at a custodial frontier that can be resolved: Bybit knows the customer of this deposit address.
  - The address has been in use since July 2025, with withdrawals from Binance, Kraken and an exchange labelled Crypto.com, so it is a durable customer account, not a single-use cash-out.

## 3. A Privacy Cash withdrawal credited that same Bybit deposit address

- **Established:**
  - At 14:55:19, 29 seconds after the beneficiary's 12.3288002 SOL deposit, Privacy Cash paid 0.9905 SOL out of 1 SOL withdrawn (decoded `ext_amount` −990,500,000) to the Bybit deposit address.
  - There was no other Privacy Cash interaction by either address, and no deposit after SemiconductorIT's credits.
- **Decisive evidence:** the decoded instruction, the pool's −1,000,000,000 lamport change and the recipient's +990,500,000 in signature `2kkJqk86KfZ1bmMqxEAMpndtSTAFyBQRp4dNy5vQryHWiKtdXJWoMp8biX2VXmyrtWzHTUQDpSbJouiMWp6y9pdh`.
- **Consequence:**
  - The pool's proof prevents matching this withdrawal to the beneficiary's deposits.
  - The withdrawer nonetheless chose the beneficiary's own exit account: this is a supported financial relation, not a demonstrated round trip.

## 4. Role of the recurring addresses and of the other exits

- `0x519fa16e9897132b7633f634b76306a327839e06` is an unlabeled transit wallet that forwards each inflow to Binance hot wallets.
- `0xa6c221448af73af8350291c5cdcd877b39683766` forwards to `0x852dc1c875f0117ea0808610010893e4c576b6a9`, an unlabeled, very active EOA. That EOA also paid `0x519fa16e…` once in June 2025.
- aaamsaasa's remaining 8,995.497557 USDC went to a Crypto.com customer deposit address, `CCQQKc4vw527ehZZhQidZZT9LEzKr4Ca7bZNwJv6BmBR`.
- The Polygon receipt missing from the earlier audit (`0xc0a30b3c70070cf81c6a48bbf5e0206413523b3113fb41cf557dd81978cd3a6b`) is now archived: 1,000 USDC.e from BlueElephant666, status 1.

## What this does not establish

- **Common control.** The four accounts were processed one after another on 28 February and forwarded by one key to one exchange account. That is a hypothesis of coordination and common control, not a demonstration.
- **Inside information.** It is not demonstrated. Among 115 wallets that bought at least 1,000 USDC of Yes between 00:00 and 06:15 UTC, the accounts rank 77th to 103rd by first buy; this exploratory comparator shows the bet timing is not distinctive. The distinctive fact is the shared exit.

## Update, later on 5 November 2026

The follow-up [`../iran-cluster-e-network-2026-11-05/`](../iran-cluster-e-network-2026-11-05/REPORT.md) supersedes two readings of this note, without changing its evidence:
- `0x519fa16e9897132b7633f634b76306a327839e06` is not a transit wallet but a Binance customer deposit address (gas from Binance: Deposit Funder 1, every inflow swept to Binance).
- oveiStheair's "BSC funder" `0xfe775af18824f4951f19e264901030f8528bf972` is oveiStheair's own deposit address. It was paid by another Polymarket account, TBFMM, which also paid BlueElephant666 directly.

That note links eleven more accounts to the four of this note and to cluster E.
